# About this project
Become a Senior React Developer! Build a massive E-commerce app with Redux, Hooks, GraphQL, ContextAPI, Stripe

A complete e-commerce React application with zero server code thanks to Firebase that provide data store and user authentication



Become a Senior React Developer! 
Build a massive E-commerce app with Redux, Hooks, GraphQL, ContextAPI, Stripe, Firebase, 

Don't forget to create your own Firebase database and add your key's into index.html page.


An important thing to note about any GitHub links that you fork and clone from this point forward is that you must replace the config  in firebase.utils.js  with your own config object in the firebase project overview that we learned in the last lesson. The config object is how firebase knows that your application is connected to your firebase account and database!



Optional: How to fix 403: restricted_client error
It's possible you may encounter a google Authorization error that says 403:restricted_client. If you do, here are the instructions to fix it!

There should be a Learn More link in the popup, clicking that should take you to the Google APIs console that has three tabs under the header named Credentials, OAuth Consent Screen, and Domain Verification. Go to the OAuth Consent Screen tab and update the Application Name to "crwn-clothing" or any other name you're comfortable with (i.e. the name of your project). Click on save at the bottom, then try logging into your verified Google account thereafter.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
